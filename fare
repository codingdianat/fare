   // For trips crossing 0 or 1 zone boundaries, students 18 or over get the same break as riders under 18.
   // The senior fare for riders 65 and over is $0.55 plus $0.35 per zone boundary crossed. However, for a trip crossing 0 boundaries, the senior fare is only $0.45. Seniors who believe in lifelong learning (i.e., are students) are no dummies: They pay the cheapest fare available to them.
